While various scientific communities aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of intelligent system, one must not forget the role of humans in the development of such systems. Data mining and machine learning techniques are for example being used in marketing, for instance to identify potential customers or analyze market baskets. Such application of AI techniques use personal data, or data that can be used to identify a person, which not only raises ethical considerations, but raises some legal implications as well. 

Data processing in general is increasingly the subject of various regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU law that came into effect in May 2018. Such initiatives spur the investment of means and resources in novel ways for facilitating compliance verification. Prior work looked into the representation of GDPR as a Linked Data resource which one can refer to and engage with; a proposal for open, semantic vocabularies to represent various actors and interactions based on a provenance ontology to facilitate compliance checking, and a simple model for capturing informed consent 
.
Use of semantic technologies in the prior work described above, is in part motivated by the standardized technologies upon which semantic technologies are built at various levels: communication (HTTP), data representation (RDF), and semantic (vocabularies and ontologies). All of these facilitate interoperability, transparency and traceability. While prior work has aimed to tackle the problems of representing a piece of legislation, the various interactions between stakeholders and capturing informed consent, we have yet to investigate the problem of rendering this information actionable: “How can one engage with the informed consent that an organization has gathered while commencing a data processing activity?” 

Here we present a model for representing consent (which can evolve over time ) and how it relates to different datasets and the uses of the model.
